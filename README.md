Switches
It cotains different scripts that we run at
1. switch-sgi
2. switch-s1c
3. switch-s1u
4. spgw-u

Most scripts are to play with the switches and see
how our p4 scripts interact with the network elements
and the in-coimg data packets.

Befor running the scripts, we installed  simple_switch
and p4c complier on the switches using the commands from https://opennetworking.org/news-and-events/blog/getting-started-with-p4/.
